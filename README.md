# README

This was the final project I did for my 3 month time at Carolina Code School. After 2.5 months of intense studying and learning how to program for the first time, we had 3 weeks to develope a unique project utilizing Ruby on Rails and third paty APIs. We then had to demo them for community members here in Greenville, SC. 

Life Pawtners:

Ever see a cool dog or cat and want one just like it? Using IBM Watson’s Visual Recognition program and Petfinder’s API, Life Pawtners allows users to upload images of animals they think look awesome to find local adoptable cats and dogs that are similar to the animals they love.

Currently only looking for adoptable animals near Greenville, SC.

Ruby, Rails, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, React, jQuery, Petfinder API, IBM Watson Visual Recognition API, Google Maps API
